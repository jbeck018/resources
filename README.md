# Resources

## What is this site?

This site is an attempt to gather a comprehensive list of resources
that would be helpful to people who have been harmed by porn.  This
includes

* parents who are concerned about porn's pervasivness and effect on
their children,
* spouses who have felt betrayed by their significant other's involvement with porn
* pastors, priests, ministers, and friends looking to counsel others
* users of porn who want to quit but can't

## What isn't this site?

This site aims to be a _list of resources_ rather than an endoresment
or recommendation of any particular resources.  A similar site that
includes recommendations and endorsements would probably be good to
create as well.

## What makes this site useful?

It is comprehensive and searchable.

## Questions

    1. Are the chosen attributes good?  Should we lose some or add others?

## I want to edit this list but don't know how to use github

Hmm.  Well, maybe we should move this site off of github.
